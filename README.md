This is my updated version of the web radio player for the M5Stack Core2. Itâ€™s based on an existing project but has been enhanced with new features and improved functionality.

Key Changes and Enhancements

- Revamped UI: Improvements to the user interface, providing a more modern and intuitive design.
- Station Navigation: Added functionality for seamless switching between radio stations (up and down).
- Volume Control: Integrated volume control to increase or decrease the audio level.
- Wi-Fi Scanning & Password Entry: The app now allows you to scan for available Wi-Fi networks and enter your Wi-Fi password. The device stores the password for easy reconnection. This is a beta release, with ongoing improvements. The on-screen keyboard's accuracy is still being worked on.
- Stream Information: Displays stream bitrate (kbps) and sampling rate (kHz) on the screen for enhanced user information.
- Bluetooth Button: Currently inactive, but in the next release, Bluetooth functionality will be added for streaming to Bluetooth speakers.
- VU Meter: Added a basic VU meter, but due to limitations of the Core2, the functionality is not fully stable and may be removed in future updates.

- VU Meter Optimization: Remove the VU meter due to hardware limitations.
